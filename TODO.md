### Requirements

### What an Art Portfolio Website needs

**Name:** Waffles - for art → use logo

#### Home page → Art w/ categories (? goes off site)

- **Illustration** → possible link to shop
- **Storyboarding** + **Concept Art**
- **Animation**
- **Photography** (later, practice more)

→ lead to more pages/sections w/ best & current work

- **Potentially add character design??**
  - *probably not yet*

#### Research what other portfolios are like

#### About page → including contacts/social media

→ short-ish blurb about what I’m doing & who I am

- **Call meet the artist**
& *reminder to make one again*

**New cover image every refresh? (possible?)** — definitely, rotate gallery

#### ⚠️ Try not to go *too* crazy with add-ons & additional decoration → will be distracting

- but still show artist style and pretty/cohesive and impressive design language
